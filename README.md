# Rover On Mars?

Group Project for Winter 2022 CS174A at UCLA

For instructions on how to run the code, refer to the below [How to Run](#how-to-run)

# Description

Ever wanted to explore Mars from the safety of your own home? How about helping to further our exploration of the cosmos by collecting Martian samples? “Rover on Mars?” is a 3rd-person Mars exploration rover simulator where you are tasked with the operation of a rover on a Martian-like landscape to explore and collect Martian samples for later analysis. The player will be able to control the rover using IJKL controls, and be able to collide with samples to collect them before a new sample becomes available in the play-area. Additionally, to enhance the player’s experience, several environmental factors can be controlled directly by the player, including the amount of dust cover, number of active samples, and time of Sol—the Martian-equivalent of an Earth day.

## How to Run

To run the game, navigate to the [`src` subdirectory](https://github.com/harrisonCassar/RoverOnMars_GroupProject_CS174A/tree/main/src), and begin a local hosting of the directory via running [`server.py`](https://github.com/harrisonCassar/RoverOnMars_GroupProject_CS174A/blob/main/src/server.py) (or by equivalent means). Open up the locally-hosted server in your browser (verified working on Google Chrome), and begin the game!

Utilize the controls specified on the control panel to navigate the rover around the Martian-like terrain, interact with the environment (via collecting crystals, colliding with the walls, etc.), explore various user options (modifying the day/night cycle, speed controls, mouse clicking on the rover's radio to play music, etc.), and most importantly: have FUN! :)
